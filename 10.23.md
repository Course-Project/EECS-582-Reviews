### What is the Problem?

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is widely used to establish session keys in many Internet protocols, such as SSH, IPsec, TLS. However, a surprising number of servers use weak Diffie-Hellman parameters or maintain support for obsolete 1990s-era export-grade crypto. Moreover, the common practice of using standardized, hard-coded, or widely shared Diffie-Hellman parameters has led to dramatically reducing the cost of large-scale attacks, bringing some within range of feasibility today.

### Summary

This paper investigates the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as used in popular Internet protocols, such as SSH, IPsec, TLS, and find it to be less secure than widely believed. The authors introduce Logjam, a new attack on TLS, by which a man-in-the-middle attacker can downgrade a connection to export-grade cryptography based on the implementations of the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. Apart from the findings on Logjam attack on 512-bit Diffie-Hellman groups, the authors also explore the implications of precomputation attacks for 768- and 1024-bit groups and further give the recommendations on countermeasures in response to the Logjam attack.

### Key Insights

- Although the cost of the precomputation for a 1024-bit group is several times higher than for an RSA key of equal size, a one-time investment could be used to attack millions of hosts, due to widespread reuse of the most common Diffie-Hellman parameters.
- The number field sieve for discrete log allows an attacker to perform a single precomputation that depends only on the group, after which computing individual logs in that group has a far lower cost.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- This is the first time that the discrete logs over larger groups have been exploited to expose concrete vulnerabilities in real-world systems. The authors largely leverage the precomputation results to accelerate the attack process for 512-bit Diffie-Hellman groups.
- This work uses ZMap toolchain to measure how HTTPS server in the wild use Diffie-Hellman among Top 1M domains, which reveals the evidence that just two 512-bit primes account for 92.3% of Alexa Top 1M domains.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- The Logjam attack only applies to 8.4% of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites and 3.4% of all HTTPS servers which are a small portion on the Internet. Furthermore, the authors do not point out whether these vulnerable websites are very commonly used or not, because the Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites include many infrequently visited sites.
- Although the authors find several approaches to keep the connections alive before finishing computing the shared secret \\(g^{ab}\\), it still takes an average of 70 seconds for the computation and most web browsers will close the connection after a minute.

### Summary of Key Results

- Many TLS servers do not use a fresh value \\(b\\) for each connection, but instead compute \\(g^{b}\\) once and reuse it for multiple negotiations. For example, without enabling the `SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE` option, OpenSSL will reuse \\(g^{b}\\) for the lifetime of a TLS context. As well the F5 BIG0IP load balancers and hardware TLS frontends will reuse \\(g^{b}\\) unless the "Single DH" option is checked. Besides, Microsoft Schannel caches \\(g^{b}\\) for two hours. By sampling IPv4 hosts serving browser-trusted certificates that support DHE, the authors find that 17% reuse \\(g^{b}\\) at least once over the course of 20 handshakes and that 15% only used one value.
- Existing settings of Diffie-Hellman in Internet protocols are still far from optimistic situations. 82% of vulnerable servers use a single 512-bit group. Performing precomputation for a single 1024-bit group would allow passive eavesdropping on 18% of popular HTTPS sites, and a second group would allow decryption of traffic to 66% of IPsec VPNs and 26% of SSH servers.

### Open Questions

Many cryptographers have already known the fact that utilizing the number field sieve for discrete log for a single precomputation on the group can largely decrease the cost. Moreover, they did not appreciate that the security of a large fraction of Internet communication depends on Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, which use a few small, widely shared groups. Why do not they implement other advanced and secure key exchange algorithms as well as push the migration to these secure algorithms?
