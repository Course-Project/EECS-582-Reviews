### What is the Problem?

Due to the reality of multi-core hardware concurrent programs are becoming prevalent in not only high-end servers but also desktop machines. However, writing good quality concurrent programs is difficult because most programmers cannot avoid thinking sequentially, leading to wrong program implementations. Moreover, concurrent programs are non-deterministic, which makes concurrency bugs difficult to repeat. Addressing this problem further requires advances in multiple directions, including concurrency bug detection, concurrent program testing, concurrent programming model design, etc.

### Summary

This paper conducts a comprehensive study of the real-world concurrency bugs to deeply characterize these real-world concurrency bugs, which can carry the development of the aforementioned research directions forward. Based on 105 randomly selected real-world concurrency bugs collected from 4 open-source applications (MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, and OpenOffice), the authors investigate the bug patterns, manifestations, fix strategies, and other characteristics of real-world concurrency bugs. Their study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guidelines for concurrency bug detection, concurrent program testing, and concurrent programming model design.

### Key Insights

- The lack of a good real-world concurrency bug characteristic study is mainly due to the difficulty of collecting real-world concurrency bugs and understanding these concurrency bugs.
- The non-determinism hinders the users from reporting concurrency bugs, which further makes concurrency bug reports difficult to get understood and solved by programmers.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- This work is the first comprehensive real-world concurrency bug characteristic study, which tackles two challenges about collecting and understanding concurrency bugs.
- The authors build a good characteristic category model covering three major aspects (including bug pattern, manifestation, and bug fix strategy). Then, they carefully examine the selected concurrency bugs based on their proposed categorization and analyze the insights.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- This paper is based on the real-world concurrency bugs from only 4 open-source applications, which means the findings in this paper cannot represent all real-world applications. The data size of the selected concurrency bugs is too small as compared with the total five hundred thousand bug reports in the database. On the other words, the selected bugs may not be fully representative.
- For the chosen characteristics, they only cover three aspects: bug pattern, manifestation, and bug fix strategy. However, they do not include failure impact and bug diagnosis process. As a comprehensive study, they should not ignore these parts.

### Summary of Key Results

- About one-third of the examined non-deadlock concurrency bugs are due to the violation to programmers' order intentions, which may not be easily expressed via synchronization primitives like locks and transactional memories.
- Around 92% of the examined concurrency bugs can be triggered by enforcing certain orders among no more than 4 memory accesses, indicating that testing concurrent programs can aim at exploring possible orders among every small group of memory accesses rather than among all memory accesses.
- According to their survey, simply adding or changing locks cannot fix 73% of the non-deadlock concurrency bugs. Moreover, many of the fixes are not correct at the first try, which indicates that it is difficult for programmers to reasoning concurrent execution.

### Open Questions

This work only provides guidelines for concurrency bug detection, concurrent program testing, and concurrent programming model design but does not cover any concrete solutions to solve related problems, such as multiple-variable concurrency bugs, order-violation bugs, etc. Besides, this study does not reveal the situation of concurrency bugs in other types of applications, such as scientific applications, operating systems, and applications written in other programming languages (e.g., Java).
