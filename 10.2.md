### What is the Problem?

Nowadays, in numerous modern systems, virtualization is essential for resources partition, which can provide performance isolation. However, existing virtualization techniques still have limitations: some rely on specialized hardware; some cannot support commodity operating systems; some cannot provide promising design decision between performance and other metrics.

<!--
Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.

There are a number of ways to build a system to host multiple applications and servers on a shared machine. Perhaps the simplest is to deploy one or more hosts running a standard operating system such as Linux or Windows, and then to allow users to install files and start processes — protection between applications being provided by conventional OS techniques. Experience shows that system administration can quickly become a time-consuming task due to complex configuration interactions between supposedly disjoint applications.

More importantly, such systems do not adequately support performance isolation; the scheduling priority, memory demand, network traffic and disk accesses of one process impact the performance of others. This may be acceptable when there is adequate provisioning and a closed user group (such as in the case of computational grids, or the experimental PlanetLab platform), but not when resources are oversubscribed, or users uncooperative. -->

### Summary

This paper describes the design of a high-performance resource-managed virtual machine monitor, Xen, which allows multiple guest operating systems to share hardware resources safely with promising performance. Their paravirtualizing design avoids the drawbacks of some old design choices like full virtualization, by providing partial virtualization where the virtual machine abstraction is similar but not identical to the underlying hardware. Moreover, their design has the same ABIs as the normal operating systems such that users can easily transition to Xen, though Xen requires modifications to the guest OS to obtain better performance.

<!-- In this paper we present Xen, a high performance resource-managed virtual machine monitor (VMM) which enables applications such as server consolidation, co-located hosting facilities, distributed web services, secure computing platforms and application mobility. -->

<!-- Our paravirtualizing design places a particular emphasis on performance and resource management. -->

<!-- We avoid the drawbacks of full virtualization by presenting a virtual machine abstraction that is similar but not identical to the underlying hardware—an approach which has been dubbed paravirtualization. This promises improved performance, although it does require modifications to the guest operating system. It is important to note, however, that we do not require changes to the application binary interface (ABI), and hence no modifications are required to guest applications. -->

### Key Insights

<!-- Key to our design is the idea that resource usage be accounted precisely and paid for by the sponsor of that job — if payments are made in real cash, we can use a congestion pricing strategy [28] to handle excess demand, and use excess revenues to pay for additional machines. -->

<!-- In a traditional VMM the virtual hardware exposed is functionally identical to the underlying machine. Although full virtualization has the obvious benefit of allowing unmodified operating systems to be hosted, it also has a number of drawbacks. This is particularly true for the prevalent IA-32, or x86, architecture. Support for full virtualization was never part of the x86 architectural design. Certain supervisor instructions must be handled by the VMM for correct virtualization, but executing these with insufficient privilege fails silently rather than causing a convenient trap. Efficiently virtualizing the x86 MMU is also difficult. These problems can be solved, but only at the cost of increased complexity and reduced performance. -->

- Hosting multiple applications and servers on a shared machine cannot adequately support performance isolation, which means the scheduling tasks, memory allocation, network traffic, and disk accesses of one process can affect the performance of others.
- Support for full virtualization was never part of the x86 architecture. Certain supervisor instructions must be handled by the VMM for correct virtualization, but executing these with insufficient privilege fails silently rather than causing a convenient trap. Efficiently virtualizing the x86 MMU is also difficult. These problems can be solved, but only at the cost of increased complexity and reduced performance.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- Xen proposes an efficient way to virtualize privilege levels for the host processor. By using unused rings (i.e., ring 1), it prevents the guest OS from directly executing privileged instructions, yet it remains safely isolated from the applications which run in ring 3.
- By reserving a 64MB section at the top of every address space, Xen avoids the TLB flush and further reduce the context switching overhead.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- Though the application binaries do not need to be modified, the Xen architecture requires modifications to the guest OS which may not often be possible in proprietary systems. For example, this paper also indicated that Windows XP required much more numbers of modifications than the Linux port.
- The system provides device I/O through device abstractions rather than emulating existing hardware devices, but device abstractions often do not expose all the features of a device.

### Summary of Key Results

- Xen can achieve promising performance and introduces only a few percent overhead compared to native linux, and it can scale up to 128 instances.
- The evaluation results also indicate that the decision choices of Xen are reasonable and effective, which eliminate parts of unnecessary virtualization in exchange for performance improvement.

### Open Questions

At first, conducting comparison evaluations with other virtualization techniques, such as KVM, Hyper-V, is essential. Furthermore, providing a comprehensive evaluation or some user reports in the realistic scenarios would be more intuitive. Although the authors claim that Xen provides promising performance improvement while comparing with old virtualization techniques, they do not present any evaluations in the real scenes, because the benchmark experiments are mostly conducted on uniform workloads. Besides, in the scope of this paper, it would also be very inspiring if they demonstrate the possibility to employ Xen in the cloud platform, which is widely used nowadays.
