### What is the Problem?

Facing with faster changing computer hardware and increasingly diverse architectural tradeoffs, the dynamic nature of modern client and server workloads, coupled with the impossibility of statically optimizing an OS for all workloads and hardware variants pose substantial scalability and correctness challenges for operating system structures. Due to this, it is no longer acceptable to tune a general-purpose OS design for a particular hardware model because optimizations become obsolete after a few years when new hardware arrives.

### Summary

In this paper, the authors embrace the networked nature of the machine and rethink OS architecture using ideas from distributed systems. They present a new OS structure, the multikernel, that introduces the design principles of explicit communication, hardware-neutral structure, and state replication. Furthermore, they implement a multikernel OS, Barrelfish, and also conduct experiments on the scalability and adaptability to hardware characteristics of Barrelfish.

### Key Insights

- The authors attribute the engineering difficulties of optimizations to the basic structure of a shared-memory kernel with data structures protected by locks.
- Building an OS using message-based rather than shared-data communication offers tangible benefits: instead of sequentially manipulating shared data structures, which is limited by the latency of remote data access, the ability to pipeline and batch messages encoding remote operations allows a single core to achieve greater throughput and reduces interconnect utilization.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- Within a multikernel OS, all inter-core communication is performed using explicit messages. Using messages to access or update state rapidly becomes more efficient than shared-memory access as the number of cache-lines involved increases. Moreover, a message-passing system has well-defined interfaces, so the structure of a message-passing system is naturally modular.
- In a multikernel, explicit communication between cores that share no memory leads naturally to a model of global OS state replicated across cores. Replicating data structures can improve system scalability by reducing the load on the system interconnect, contention for memory, and overhead for synchronization.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- This paper does not show great advantages over the traditional OS. For each experiment, the performance of Barrelfish is almost equivalent to Linux, which means it does not provide many benefits. Although the authors argue that Linux and Windows have made an enormous investment in optimizations for current hardware, Barrelfish cannot still fully outperform them in one specific architecture.

### Summary of Key Results

- For IP loopback, Barrelfish uses URPC to connect two user-space IP stacks such that it can achieve the equivalent functionality for point-to-point links. Barrelfish achieves higher throughput, fewer cache misses, and lower interconnect utilization.
- Barrelfish has better scalability than Linux due to its user-space threads library implementation. For Linux, it implements barriers using a system call, whereas the library implementation of Barrelfish exhibits different scaling properties under contention.

### Open Questions

The authors argue that Barrelfish performs reasonably on contemporary hardware, but Barrelfish has not become the mainstream of modern OS. In this paper, the authors do not describe the set of exposed interfaces of hardware, while they just state the design principles. We are not sure whether a fully optimized Barrelfish can largely outperform Linux and Windows or not.
