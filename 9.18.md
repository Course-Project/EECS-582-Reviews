### What is the Problem?

By providing fixed high-level operating system abstractions, such as interprocess communication and virtual memory, the traditional operating systems limit the performance, flexibility, and functionality of applications.

### Summary

In this paper, the authors proposed a new operating system architecture, exokernel, to address the limitations of the traditional operating systems on the performance, flexibility, and functionality through application-level resource management. To improve the performance, reduce the complexity, and provide maximum freedom for functionality, the exokernel architecture acts as a secure multiplexer of physical resources through a set of low-level primitives. The authors claim that the design of the exokernel provides domain-specific optimizations, the freedom to modify the implementation of existing abstractions, and high flexibility for application builders.

### Key Insights

- The exokernel architecture is based on a simple observation that providing lower-level primitives leads to more efficient implementations and grants more latitude to implementors of higher-level abstractions. It is applications that know better about what the goal of their resource management decisions should be. Thus, they should take as much control as possible over the physical resources.
- Secure multiplexing does not require sophisticated algorithms and can be fulfilled by tracking ownership of resources. Thus, the exokernel can be simply implemented as well as improves reliability and ease of maintenance.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- Besides giving library operating systems, which works above the exokernel interface, much freedom in managing physical resources, the exokernel applies a strategy to separate resource protection from management by employing secure bindings, visible revocation, and abort protocol. In this case, the exokernel can protect applications from each other so that any errors in one application should not result in errors in other applications
- In application level, to implement the abstractions in library operating systems can be simpler and more specialized than in-kernel implementations, because they only need to focus on their application requirements without considering the competition for resources with other applications. Furthermore, since library operating systems can be replaced without any special privileges, enough portability and compatibility can be easily guaranteed, and this also simplifies future development of new functionalities.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- The exokernel fully takes the performance, flexibility, and functionality of applications into consideration, but it ignores the trade-off between software engineering and ideal designs. Since not all the applications require perfect performance, flexibility, and functionality, and to implement specific library operating systems need many efforts, employing exokernel may result in great burdens to the developers.
- This paper only presents some specific benchmarks for the exokernel without showing the performance of applications in the real world. Moreover, the applications in the real world can be much more complicated than ExOS. Implementing and evaluating such applications above the exokernel architecture should be more practical and meaningful.

### Summary of Key Results

- Due to the low-level interface, the exokernel provides applications with greater flexibility and better performance. Most primitive kernel operations (e.g., exception handling) are 10 to 100 times faster than in Ultrix.
- For library operating systems, application-level implementations of high-level operating system abstractions (e.g., virtual memory, interprocess communication) are 5 to 40 times faster than Ultrix's kernel primitives.

### Open Questions

Although the exokernel does address the limitations of the traditional operating system and provides the applications with maximum freedom for functionality, it requires the developers to customize different library operating systems, which costs extra efforts. Thus, to encourage the community actively get involved in the development of diverse fundamental library operating systems is the key to success. In other words, the exokernel should consider the trade-off between the ease of use and the high performance.
