Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?

### What is the Problem?

Sometimes, a program works well, but, after applying a number of changes, the program may no longer work as it should. Since one programmer can produce many changes in a day, it is not easy to analyze all the changes manually and find the root causes. How can we quickly and automatically locate the changes which are responsible for the failure? And how can we isolate the changes that caused the failure and make the program work again?

### Summary

This paper presents a technology named delta debugging, which starts from the differences between the old and the new version and determine the causes for program behavior by looking at these differences (i.e., the deltas). The authors leverage their *dd*<sup>+</sup> algorithm to handle interference, inconsistencies, and granularity problems and generalize regression containment automatically. At last, they give practical case studies to show how the failures can be resolved automatically.

### Key Insights

- Delta debugging works the better the smaller the differences are. However, the changes produced by a programmer in a day can be too large for a human to trace. In general, conventional debugging strategies lead to faster results.
- After Ness and Ngo present regression containment, delta debugging becomes an alternative when the differences can be narrowed down automatically.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths

- This paper presents a solid and formal definition for delta debugging, which may be easy for formal verifications.
- Delta debugging solves a very important practical problem, inconsistent configurations. The authors extend *dd* algorithm to deal with these inconsistent configurations.

### Limitations/Weaknesses

- The extended *dd*<sup>+</sup> algorithm may not generate minimal set of configurations.

### Summary of Key Results

- Delta debugging can largely reduce the possible changes that can cause failures.

### Open Questions

This paper does not fully avoid inconsistencies. Moreover, this paper also does not consider about the changes that will not be executed in the future. Delta debugging does not exclude these parts.
